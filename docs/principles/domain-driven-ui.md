# Domain-Driven UI

From a product design perspective, domain-driven UI (User Interface) is an approach that aligns the user interface closely with the underlying domain model and business logic of an application. This methodology aims to create more intuitive, efficient, and maintainable user interfaces by reflecting the core concepts and workflows of the business domain directly in the UI design.

## Key Aspects of Domain-Driven UI

### Domain Alignment

The UI is structured to mirror the key concepts, relationships, and processes of the business domain. This creates a more intuitive interface for users who are familiar with the domain.

### Ubiquitous Language

The UI incorporates the same terminology and concepts used by domain experts and stakeholders, fostering clearer communication between users, designers, and developers.

### Context-Specific Interfaces

Different bounded contexts within the domain may have their own specialized UI components and interactions, reflecting the unique needs of each subdomain.

## Design Considerations

### User Mental Models

Designers must understand not just the technical domain model, but also how users conceptualize the domain in their daily work. The UI should bridge any gaps between these perspectives.

### Flexibility and Evolution

As the domain model evolves, the UI must be adaptable enough to accommodate changes without requiring a complete redesign.

### Balancing Domain Purity and Usability

While closely aligning with the domain is important, designers must also ensure the interface remains user-friendly and doesn't expose unnecessary complexity.

## Benefits

- Reduced cognitive load for users familiar with the domain
- Improved communication between stakeholders due to shared language
- More efficient workflows that match real-world processes
- Easier maintenance and updates as the UI and domain model evolve in tandem

## Challenges

- Potential for overly complex interfaces if the domain model is not well-designed
- Risk of creating interfaces that are too specialized for general users
- Need for close collaboration between UI designers and domain experts

Domain-driven UI represents a holistic approach to product design that emphasizes deep understanding of the business domain and its translation into user interface elements. While it can lead to highly effective and tailored user experiences, it requires careful consideration of user needs and usability principles to ensure the resulting product remains accessible and efficient for all users.

## Interaction with Mouldable UI Components

- Domain-Driven UI components can interact with Mouldable UI components to provide domain-specific functionality while maintaining flexibility.
